The following are some of the  problem statement 

1. Problem: Develop a machine learning classifier to predict COVID-19 infection risk using symptoms like cough, fever and contact history data.

2. Binary classification to predict if a person has COVID-19 or not based on their features.  

3. Dataset has columns for symptoms like cough, fever, sore throat etc. Also contains contact history variable.

4. 'Corona' or 'Known_contact' columns can be used as the target variable for prediction.

5. Evaluate performance of models like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression.

6. Tune hyperparameters of best model using RandomizedSearchCV and k-fold cross validation.

7. Thoroughly evaluate models on test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

The following are some of the conclutions.

1. Develop ML classifier for COVID-19 prediction from symptoms, contact data

2. Binary classification problem to predict COVID-19 positive or negative

3. Symptoms and contact history as predictor features  

4. 'Corona' or 'Known_contact' as target variable

5. Evaluate models like Random Forests, SVM, Logistic Regression

6. Tuning best model via RandomizedSearchCV and k-fold CV

7. Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
